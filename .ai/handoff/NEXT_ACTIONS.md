# failprompt: Next Actions

> Last updated: 2026-02-21
> Priority order. Work top-down.

---

## 1. npm publish (requires human action)

**Goal:** Make `failprompt` available via `npx failprompt` globally.

**What needs to happen:**
1. Emre runs `npm login` in a terminal (browser 2FA for npmjs.com)
2. Agent runs: `npm version patch && npm run build && npm publish --access public`
3. Verify: `npx failprompt --version` works from any directory

**Notes:**
- `package.json` already has: `bin`, `files` whitelist, `prepublishOnly: "npm run build"`, `publishConfig: { access: "public" }`
- No other prep needed - ship as is

## 2. GitLab CI support (Phase 2, after npm publish)

**Goal:** Support GitLab pipelines in addition to GitHub Actions.

GitLab uses `CI_JOB_NAME`, `CI_PIPELINE_ID` env vars and the `gitlab-ci.yml` log format.
The `log-fetcher.ts` would need a GitLab adapter alongside the existing `gh` shell-out.

## 3. ESLint setup (optional)

Add `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` with strict rules. Low priority - code is already
clean and type-safe. Nice to have for contribution hygiene.
