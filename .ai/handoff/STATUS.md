## Build Health

| Check        | Result    | Notes                                        |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `tsc`        | ✅ Clean  | Strict mode, NodeNext, zero errors           |
| `npm test`   | ✅ 42/42  | 3 suites: extractor, prompt-builder, integration |
| GitHub CI    | ✅ Live   | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on main           |
| npm publish  | ⏳ Pending | Needs `npm login` (human action)             |

## What Exists

| File | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| `src/index.ts` | Verified | CLI entrypoint, commander, --run/--repo/--output/--verbose |
| `src/log-fetcher.ts` | Verified | gh shell-out, auth check, friendly error messages |
| `src/error-extractor.ts` | Verified | gh log format parsing (job/step/timestamp), ##[error] markers, extended heuristics, last-30 fallback |
| `src/prompt-builder.ts` | Verified | structured LLM prompt, source file context |
| `src/__tests__/error-extractor.test.ts` | Verified | 17 tests |
| `src/__tests__/prompt-builder.test.ts` | Verified | 12 tests |
| `src/__tests__/integration.test.ts` | Verified | 13 tests - 3 realistic scenarios (TS error, npm ERR!, Jest failure) |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Verified | Runs on every push, node 20 |
| `dist/` | Verified | Compiled, shebang present, bin field wired |
| `README.md` | Verified | Usage examples, AAHP case study note |

## Tested End-to-End

The tool was tested against a real GitHub Actions failure in its own repo (run `22257459273`):
- Auto-detected repo: `homeofe/failprompt`
- Auto-detected branch: `main`
- Auto-detected latest failed run - no flags needed
- Correctly identified failing step: `Run tests`
- Extracted exact assertion error with line number
- Included relevant source file context automatically

## What is Missing

| Gap             | Severity | Notes                          |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| npm publish     | MEDIUM   | Needs `npm login` from Emre    |
| GitLab CI       | LOW      | Phase 2, after npm publish     |
| ESLint          | LOW      | Optional, nice to have         |

## Trust Levels

- **(Verified)**: confirmed by running code/tests/real CI
- **(Assumed)**: derived from config, not directly tested
- **(Unknown)**: needs verification
